# Titan examples

## a clock with bacon for hands
Butterfinger
Visualize a quirky clock featuring hands made of sizzling, crispy bacon, adding a delicious and playful twist. Each tick-tock tells time in a unique way, with Butterfinger branding subtly integrated into the clock face or frame, enhancing the whimsical and appetizing design.	

The resulting image had bacon in the background of the clock not as the hands. It also lacked Butterfinger branding.


## a woman's wristwatch made of ironwork with emerald
Lululemon
Create an elegant wristwatch for women crafted with intricate ironwork details and adorned with a stunning emerald, embodying the essence of Lululemon's style and sophistication. The design seamlessly blends durability with a touch of luxury, appealing to individuals who appreciate both fashion and functionality.	

The resulting image was good but the branding was too subtle; it tried to write Lululemon rather than include the icon. It also didn't do an ironwork style watch

McDonald's
Illustrate a charming cartoon family of scorpions joyfully heading to school in the morning. The littlest scorpion, donning a delightful backpack and lunch box, could proudly carry McDonald's branded lunch items, adding a playful touch to the scene.

Good: BK logo, fortress, fries
Bad: The logo was mangled, royal essence

Kool-Aid
Transform the scene into a vibrant party, energized by lacrosse bros engaging in lively camaraderie. Amidst the excitement, prominently showcase Kool-Aid drinks being enthusiastically enjoyed, enhancing the festive atmosphere with bursts of colorful refreshment.	

Good: Lacrose and had Kool Aid
