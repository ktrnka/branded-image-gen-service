This is a demo of running Slack Bolt in Socket Mode on my local machine.

Nice aspects of this:
- Easy to install dependencies
- Easy to install / cache the embedding model on lookup
- Easy to control secrets

Not so nice aspects:
- It only runs on my machine
- It probably wouldn't be able to run long-term
